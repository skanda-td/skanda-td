# Hi 👋, I'm Skanda Tejaswi D

🚀 **About Me** : Backend Engineer building production-ready services with Java and Spring Boot, focused on clean business logic, reliable APIs, and data correctness. I enjoy solving backend problems that value clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability. Outside work, I like building small things and reading broadly out of curiosity.

💼 **Current Work** : Working on backend services using Java and Spring Boot, with a focus on SQL-heavy workflows and production reliability.

📚 **Learning & Growth** : Improving problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms.
